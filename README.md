# Structure Signatures 🔐

**A Behavior-Bound Signature Framework Based on Resonance Functions**

This repository implements a prototype for [Structural Cryptography](https://zenodo.org/record/15258503), a novel cryptographic paradigm where each signature encodes spatiotemporal behavior using continuous structure functions and zero-knowledge residual proofs.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Structure-bound signatures: $\phi(x)$ encodes dynamic behavior.
- ✅ Residual-based verification: Only actions satisfying $\delta(x) < \varepsilon$ are valid.
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256-based parameter derivation.
- ✅ Zero-knowledge proof simulation for $\delta$ compliance (Bulletproofs-ready).
- ✅ Support for fixed vs. randomized structure functions.
- ✅ Delta tracking + matplotlib visualization.

## 🧠 Background

Traditional digital signatures bind a static message to an identity. Structure Signatures go further:

> A signature is only valid **if it results from a compliant behavior along a structure trajectory**.

This work is based on:

- [Structure Arithmetic: A Resonant Number Theory of Zeta Zeros and $\delta(x)$ ]https://zenodo.org/records/15330643
- Post-quantum motivation, cryptographic binding, and residual analysis.
